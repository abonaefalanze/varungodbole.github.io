## About me

My name is Varun Godbole. I'm a software engineer on the [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) team, working on program synthesis. For example, I'm currently doing research on using ML to produce code completion suggestions inside Google's internal IDE. See [this](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/07/ml-enhanced-code-completion-improves.html) blog post for more details.

Prior to this work, I spent five years working at the intersection of machine learning and medical imaging. I was a co-first author of the Nature paper [International evaluation of an AI system for breast cancer screening](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1799-6).

All of the opinions on this blog are my own. They do not reflect the opinions of my employer.
